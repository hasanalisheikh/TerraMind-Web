            Most agricultural AI was built for broadacre commodity crops —
            corn, wheat, soy — and bent to fit everything else. We&rsquo;re
            going the other way. Horticulture is its own world: trees that take
            years to bear, vines that depend on a single frost-free night, fruit
            picked by hand. What we build for it should match — end to end, from
            the sensor in the soil to the line on the ledger. We&rsquo;re
            launching from Aotearoa because that&rsquo;s where we live and where
            the listening tour starts — the goal isn&rsquo;t a dashboard growers
            tolerate, it&rsquo;s a system they trust enough to stake a season on.
